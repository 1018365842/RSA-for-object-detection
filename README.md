# Recurrent Scale Approximation (RSA) for Object Detection

![](result.jpg) 

Codebase for *Recurrent Scale Approximation for Object Detection in CNN* published at **ICCV 2017**, [[arXiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.09531). Here we offer the training and test code for two modules in the paper, `scale-forecast network` and `recurrent scale approximation (RSA)`. Models for face detection trained on some open datasets are also provided.

**Due to the terms of protection for copyright in SenseTime, the code will be released later. Please stay tuned for more features soon!**
